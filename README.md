# Car Dataset Analysis

This project is a simple yet insightful data analysis on a car dataset, inspired by the **Data Science Lover** YouTube tutorial: [Project - 2 | Data Analysis with Python | Cars Dataset](https://youtu.be/fhiUl7f5DnI?si=cK9B1NMnOXB4j1h1). The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset to extract meaningful insights and trends.

## Project Highlights:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured data consistency for better analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted descriptive statistics and visualized key car attributes such as horsepower, price, and mileage using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Data Visualization:** Created insightful plots to understand relationships and trends in the dataset, including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
- **Feature Correlation:** Analyzed relationships between variables, such as price vs. engine size, fuel efficiency, and car brand.
- **Key Insights:** Derived conclusions about the car market trends, most important features, and how various factors affect car prices.

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Pandas)
- Jupyter Notebook
